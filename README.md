# Quantum-Optical-ConvNet
A repository for the 10th Grade Research Project Constructing a Quantum Optical Convolutional Neural Network (QOCNN) and providing scripts that evaluate future feasibility.

Much of the codebase here is taken from https://github.com/mike-fang/imprecise_optical_neural_network. Modifications are contained within the subfolder trained_models, and significant parts of mnist.py, optical_nn.py, and train_mnist.py have been written by us. In addition, the subfolder Data and the files ROC Curves.ipynb, t1-t10.pt, and y1-y10.pt are completely new.
